# 🏄‍♂️ Welcome to my page
I'm a future Computer Science student with some experience in Embedded Systems and IoT through personal projects. I'm interested in fields that combine mathematics and programming, such as Quantitative Finance or AI/ML, particularly in NLP, Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
In high school, I first discovered the world of computing through Arduino and Espressif boards. The ability to create unique contraptions fascinated me so I built many, yes many projects, ranging from easy projects that you can easily search up on the internet like an alarm or a wireless light switch to a Machine Learning integrated project that earned me second place in a Science Fair and will compete in the Vietnam Science and Engineering Fair (ViSEF).
I also do some competitive programming as a hobby, achieving USACO Silver after a few months of preparation.
Looking ahead, I want to contribute to the tech industry – whether by landing an internship at a big tech company or a top quant firm, or even launching my own startup.
And in the next four year at university, I will mold the future.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
In high school, I first discovered the world of computing through Arduino and Espressif boards. The ability to create unique contraptions using hardware and software fascinated me so I built many, yes many projects, ranging from easy projects that you can easily search on YouTube like an alarm clock, a radar system and a wireless light switch to a Machine Learning-integrated device that earned me second place in a Science Fair and is set to compete in the Vietnam Science and Engineering Fair (ViSEF).
I also do some competitive programming as a hobby, achieving USACO Silver after a few months of preparation.
Looking ahead, I want to contribute to the tech industry – whether by landing an internship at a big tech company or a top quant firm, or even launching my own startup.
These tiny but complicated microcontrollers have shaped my journey and laid a solid foundation of knowledge and experiences for my future. My passion and hobby have the same starting point. Sometimes they intertwine, and, hopefully, they will be together at the end.
